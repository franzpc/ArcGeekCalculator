# Key Features - Version 3.0

## NEW in Version 3.0:
    - Enhanced Image Classification: Advanced machine learning classification with Random Forest, SVM, GMM, and KNN algorithms, including scientific accuracy assessment and comprehensive HTML reports
    - Least Cost Path Finder: Advanced path optimization with multiple optimization levels, flat terrain sensitivity, and support for drainage analysis, hiking trails, and utility corridors
    - Tree Planting Pattern Generator: Generate optimal planting patterns (Triangular/Quincunx, Rectangular/Square, Five of Diamonds) for forestry and agricultural planning

## Geometric and Coordinate Tools:
    1. Calculate Coordinates: Add XY coordinates to point layers, convert to Decimal Degrees, and provide two formats of Degrees Minutes Seconds.
    2. Calculate Line Geometry: Calculate length and azimuth for line features.
    3. Calculate Polygon Geometry: Calculate area and perimeter for polygon features.
    4. Calculate Angles: Calculate internal and external angles at vertices of lines or polygons.
    5. Go to XY: Quickly navigate to specific coordinates on the map and optionally create point markers.

## Point and Line Processing:
    6. Extract Ordered Points from Polygons: Extract and order points from the vertices of input polygons with bi-directional numbering.
    7. Lines to Ordered Points: Convert line features to ordered point features.
    8. Calculate Line from Coordinates and Table: Generate a line and points from starting coordinates and a table of distances and angles.

## Hydrological Analysis:
    9. Stream Network with Order: Generate a stream network with Strahler order.
    10. Watershed Basin Delineation: Delineate watershed basins from a DEM and pour points with main channel extension.
    11. Watershed Morphometric Analysis: Perform a comprehensive morphometric analysis of a watershed, calculating various parameters and providing their interpretations.
    12. Calculate Global Curve Number: Calculate CN values using global datasets for hydrological analysis.

## Terrain and Topographic Analysis:
    13. Topographic Profile: Generate interactive topographic profiles from lines and DEMs with advanced visualization.
    14. Least Cost Path Finder: Advanced path optimization for drainage channels, hiking trails, utility lines, and irrigation planning.

## Land Analysis and Raster Processing:
    15. Land Use Change Detection: Analyze changes in land use between two time periods.
    16. Weighted Sum Analysis: Perform weighted sum analysis on multiple raster layers.
    17. Optimized Parcel Division: Divide rectangular parcels into lots of specified width.
    18. Dam Flood Simulation: Simulate flooding based on a DEM and specified water level.

## Machine Learning and Advanced Analysis:
    19. Enhanced Image Classification: Machine learning classification with scientific accuracy assessment.
    20. Kriging Analysis: Perform spatial interpolation using Kriging (requires external libraries).
    21. Satellite Index Calculator: Calculate various satellite indices (NDVI, NDWI, etc.) for different satellites.

## Forestry and Agricultural Planning:
    22. Tree Planting Pattern Generator: Generate optimal tree planting patterns with comparative density analysis.

## Data Management and Export:
    23. Basemap Manager: Add and manage basemaps from Google Maps, Esri, Bing, and others.
    24. Screen Capture: Capture and georeference the current map view.
    25. Export to CSV: Export vector layer attributes to CSV format compatible with Excel.
    26. Export Contours to 3D CAD: Export contour lines to DXF format preserving elevation values.

## External Dependencies:
Some tools require additional Python packages:
- Enhanced Image Classification: scikit-learn, numpy (matplotlib, seaborn for full reports)
- Kriging Analysis: pykrige, scipy
- Topographic Profile: plotly
- Hypsometric Curves: plotly, numpy
