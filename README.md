    - Optional point labeling with customizable distance threshold
    - Automatic profile smoothing based on total distance
    - Interactive HTML output with downloadable point data
    - Profile area visualization with modern color scheme
    - Detailed elevation statistics and distance measurements

### Path Optimization and Analysis
14. **Least Cost Path Finder**: Advanced path optimization algorithm with multiple optimization levels and flat terrain sensitivity for drainage channels, hiking trails, and utility corridors.

### Land Analysis and Raster Processing
15. **Land Use Change Detection**: Analyze changes in land use between two time periods.
16. **Weighted Sum Analysis**: Perform weighted sum analysis on multiple raster layers.
17. **Optimized Parcel Division**: Divide rectangular parcels into lots of specified width.
18. **Dam Flood Simulation**: Simulate flooding based on a DEM and specified water level.

### Machine Learning and Classification
19. **Enhanced Image Classification**: Advanced machine learning classification with multiple algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, GMM, K-NN) and scientific accuracy assessment following remote sensing standards.

### Forestry and Agricultural Planning
20. **Tree Planting Pattern Generator**: Generate optimal tree planting patterns including Triangular/Quincunx, Rectangular/Square, and Five of Diamonds patterns with configurable spacing and comparative density analysis.

### Advanced Analysis and Remote Sensing
21. **Kriging Analysis**: Perform spatial interpolation using Kriging (requires external libraries).
22. **Satellite Index Calculator**: Calculate various satellite indices (NDVI, NDWI, etc.) for different satellites.

### Data Management and Export
23. **Basemap Manager**: Add and manage basemaps from Google Maps, Esri, Bing, and others.
24. **Screen Capture**: Capture and georeference the current map view.
25. **Export to CSV**: Export vector layer attributes to CSV format compatible with Excel.
26. **Export Contours to 3D CAD**: Export contour lines to DXF format preserving elevation values, making them compatible with AutoCAD, Civil 3D, BricsCAD, and other CAD software.
